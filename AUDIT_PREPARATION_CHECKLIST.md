## Known Issues & Design Decisions

### Intentional Design Choices

1. **Testnet Thresholds vs Mainnet**
   - Testnet uses relaxed thresholds for easier testing
   - All security logic is identical, only threshold values differ
   - **Not a vulnerability** - documented configuration choice

2. **1-of-3 Consensus Rejection Testing**
   - 1-of-3 consensus correctly rejected in tests
   - This validates 2-of-3 enforcement works properly
   - **Expected behavior** - not a bug

3. **Slippage Protection Documentation Only (FIX #4)**
   - Framework documented but not implemented
   - Trinity focuses on consensus verification, NOT token swaps
   - Future feature for potential swap integration
   - **Out of scope** - not a core feature

### Open Questions for Auditors

1. **Validator Collusion Resistance**
   - Current: 2-of-3 consensus assumes honest majority
   - Question: Additional cryptoeconomic penalties needed?
   - Mitigation: Validator rotation + slashing (planned)

2. **Cross-Chain Communication Security**
   - Current: Merkle root verification via validator signatures
   - Question: Light client verification needed?
   - Trade-off: Complexity vs security vs cost

3. **Gas Optimization vs Security**
   - Achieved 33-40% gas savings
   - Question: Any security compromises in optimizations?
   - Auditor Review: Verify storage packing doesn't create vulnerabilities

4. **Emergency Pause Mechanism**
   - Centralized emergency controller (can pause operations)
   - Question: Acceptable risk vs requirement for rapid response?
   - Mitigation: Multi-sig emergency controller planned

### Out of Scope

‚ùå **NOT auditing these:**
- Frontend code (client/)
- Backend API (server/)
- Integration test suite (testing infrastructure)
- Deployment scripts (non-critical)
- Solana programs (separate audit planned)
- TON contracts (separate audit planned)
