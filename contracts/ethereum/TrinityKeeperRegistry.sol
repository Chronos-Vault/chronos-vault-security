 * @notice Decentralized keeper registry with bond/slashing mechanism for exit batching automation
 * 
 * ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 * 🎯 ARCHITECTURE (v3.5.19 - VRF Integration)
 * ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 * 
 * Design Goals:
 * 1. Eliminate single point of failure (no "owner-only keeper" model)
 * 2. Economic security via slashing (keepers lose bond for malicious behavior)
 * 3. Automated keeper rotation (if keeper fails, next keeper takes over)
 * 4. Performance-based reputation (track successful vs failed batches)
 * 5. Reward distribution (keepers earn fees from batch submissions)
 * 6. TRUE RANDOMNESS via VRF (prevents validator gaming) [v3.5.19]
 * 
 * Keeper Lifecycle:
 * 1. Register: Post 1 ETH bond + pass reputation check
 * 2. Activate: Wait for activation period (prevent sybil attacks)
 * 3. Submit: Process exit batches and earn fees
 * 4. Slash: Lose bond if submit fraudulent/invalid batches
 * 5. Withdraw: Withdraw bond after cooldown period (if no slashing)
 * 
 * Security Model:
 * - Minimum bond: 1 ETH (prevents sybil attacks)
 * - Activation delay: 24 hours (prevents instant malicious registration)
 * - Cooldown period: 7 days (allows time for challenges)
 * - Slash percentage: 100% for fraud, 10% for negligence
 * - Max active keepers: 100 (prevents governance attacks)
 * - VRF randomness: True random keeper selection (v3.5.19)
