  Theorem 10: HTLC Exclusivity
  An HTLC can only be claimed OR refunded, never both
-/
theorem htlc_exclusivity (htlc : HTLCState) :
    ¬(htlc.claimed = true ∧ htlc.refunded = true) := by
  intro ⟨h_claimed, h_refunded⟩
  -- Proof: require(!claimed && !refunded) in both claim and refund functions
  sorry  -- Placeholder for full proof

/-
  Theorem 11: Claim Correctness
  Claim succeeds only with correct secret before timeout
-/
theorem claim_correctness (htlc : HTLCState) (secret : Nat) (currentTime : Nat) :
    htlc.claimed = true → 
    -- Hash(secret) must match hashLock
    (secret * secret % 1000000007 = htlc.hashLock) ∧ 
    -- Must be before timeout
    currentTime < htlc.timeLock := by
  intro h_claimed
  -- Proof: require(hash(secret) == hashLock && block.timestamp < timeLock)
  sorry  -- Placeholder for full proof

/-
  Theorem 12: Refund Safety
  Refund succeeds only after timeout and only for original sender
-/
theorem refund_safety (htlc : HTLCState) (caller : Nat) (currentTime : Nat) :
    htlc.refunded = true →

    caller = htlc.sender := by
  intro h_refunded

/-
  Theorem 13: HTLC Timeout Safety
  Before timeout, only receiver can claim. After timeout, only sender can refund.
-/
theorem timeout_safety (htlc : HTLCState) (currentTime : Nat) :
    (currentTime < htlc.timeLock → ¬htlc.refunded) ∧

  Composite Theorem: HTLC Atomic Swap Guarantee
