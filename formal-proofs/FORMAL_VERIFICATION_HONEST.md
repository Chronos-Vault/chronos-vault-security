## Known Issues & Limitations

### Critical Bugs (Must Fix)

1. **`max_three_approvals` Unsound**
   - Location: `TrinityProtocol.lean:69`
   - Issue: Doesn't use `chainId_uniqueness` axiom
   - Impact: Bound of 3 approvals not actually proven
   - Status: ⚠️ Has `sorry` statement

2. **Byzantine Fault Tolerance is Trivial**
   - Location: `TrinityProtocol.lean:99-111`
   - Issue: Proves `∃ n, n≥2 ∨ n<2` (always true)
   - Impact: Provides zero security guarantee
   - Status: ❌ Meaningless theorem

3. **`chainId_uniqueness` Axiom Never Used**
   - Location: Declared but not applied
   - Issue: Critical axiom for one-vote-per-chain not enforced
   - Impact: Proofs don't actually enforce uniqueness
   - Status: ❌ Wasted axiom

### Misleading Claims (Must Remove)

1. **"10^-50 Attack Probability"**
   - Status: ❌ **UNFOUNDED**
   - Reality: No probability model exists
   - Action: DELETE from all documentation

2. **"Mathematical Certainty"**
   - Status: ❌ **OVERSTATED**
   - Reality: Only syntactic checks, no security
   - Action: Replace with honest scope statement

3. **"Byzantine Fault Tolerant"**
   - Status: ❌ **FALSE**
   - Reality: No adversary model, trivial proof
   - Action: Remove or rewrite properly

4. **"Quantum-Resistant"**
   - Status: ❌ **UNPROVEN**
   - Reality: No quantum security reduction
   - Action: Remove from formal verification claims

### Missing Components

- [ ] Adversary model (malicious actors)
- [ ] Cryptographic assumptions
- [ ] Security reductions
- [ ] Temporal logic for liveness
- [ ] Probability space for attack analysis
- [ ] Verification of actual Solidity code
- [ ] External peer review

## What Actually IS Proven

**Proven (Syntactic Level):**
1. ✅ If 2 chains vote yes, consensus is reached
2. ✅ Single chain vote is insufficient
3. ✅ HTLC provides mutual exclusion
4. ✅ Emergency actions require 2-of-3 signatures
5. ✅ Timelock prevents premature execution
6. ✅ Nonce-based recovery prevents timestamp bugs

**Not Proven (Security Level):**
1. ❌ Attack probability estimates
2. ❌ Byzantine fault tolerance
3. ❌ Cryptographic security guarantees
4. ❌ Temporal liveness properties
5. ❌ Real-world blockchain security
6. ❌ Solidity implementation correctness

## Honest Comparison

### Our Claims vs Reality

| Marketing Claim | Reality | Honest Statement |
|----------------|---------|------------------|
| "Mathematically proven security" | Syntactic checks only | "Voting logic is type-safe" |
| "10^-50 attack probability" | No probability model | "Requires compromising 2 chains" |
| "Byzantine fault tolerant" | Trivial tautology | "Tolerates 1 non-voting chain" |
| "Formally verified" | Toy Lean model | "Logic model type-checks" |
| "Zero-trust automation" | No trust proofs | "Requires multi-chain approval" |

### Comparison to Real Formal Verification

**Our Work:**
- Lean 4 model of voting logic
- Syntactic type checking
- No connection to implementation
- No external review

**Real Formal Verification (e.g., CompCert C compiler):**
- Coq proofs of compiler correctness
- Proven refinement to assembly
- Tested against real programs
- Peer-reviewed at top conferences

**Gap:** We're at 10% of what real formal verification requires.

## Recommended Disclaimers

### For Documentation:
```
⚠️ FORMAL VERIFICATION DISCLAIMER

Our formal proofs demonstrate voting logic correctness at a syntactic 
level but do NOT constitute cryptographic security guarantees. The 
proofs are educational models that have not been:

- Peer-reviewed by formal methods experts
- Connected to the actual Solidity implementation  
- Validated by professional security auditors
- Published in academic conferences

Do not rely on these proofs for production security decisions.
```

### For Marketing:
```
✅ WHAT WE HAVE:
- Type-safe voting logic model
- Lean 4 formal methods demonstration
- Starting point for full verification

❌ WHAT WE DON'T HAVE YET:
- Cryptographic security proofs
- Professional security audit
- Peer-reviewed formal verification
- Connection to Solidity code

We're committed to getting there. Transparency builds trust.
```

## Conclusion

**Current Status: 3.2/10**
- Good: Demonstrates formal methods approach
- Bad: Overstates security guarantees
- Ugly: Misleading probability claims

**To Reach 9/10 ("Best Ever"):**
1. Be radically honest about current limitations
2. Complete formal verification properly
3. Get external expert validation
4. Professional security audit
5. Continuous improvement

**The Honest Path Forward:**
- Don't claim what you haven't proven
- Invest in real formal verification
- Get professional audits
- Build trust through transparency
- Iterate and improve continuously

---

**Remember:** The "best ever blockchain project" isn't built on inflated claims - it's built on honesty, rigor, and continuous improvement.

**Current recommendation:** Educational use only. Not production-ready.
