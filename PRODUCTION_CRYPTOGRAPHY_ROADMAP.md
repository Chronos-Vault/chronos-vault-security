**CURRENT STATE**: All cryptographic modules are SIMULATED for demonstration
**TARGET STATE**: Production-grade mathematical verification with audited libraries
**TIMELINE**: Must be completed before mainnet deployment

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Phase 1: Zero-Knowledge Proof System (CRITICAL)
**Status**: üî¥ Simulated - Replace before production

#### Required Implementations:
1. **Replace** `optimized-zk-proof-system.ts` with real zkSNARK implementation
2. **Library Integration**:
   - Primary: `snarkjs` (audited JavaScript zkSNARK library)
   - Circuit Generation: `circom` (arithmetic circuit compiler)
   - Alternative: `arkworks` (Rust ecosystem for ZK)

#### Technical Requirements:
```typescript
// REPLACE simulated proofs with:
import * as snarkjs from "snarkjs";

class ProductionZKSystem {
  async generateProof(circuit: string, input: any): Promise<ZKProof> {
    // Use real zkSNARK generation
    const { proof, publicSignals } = await snarkjs.groth16.fullProve(
      input,
      circuit + ".wasm",
      circuit + ".zkey"
    );
    return { proof, publicSignals };
  }
  
  async verifyProof(proof: ZKProof, vkey: any): Promise<boolean> {
    // Use real verification
    return await snarkjs.groth16.verify(vkey, proof.publicSignals, proof.proof);
  }
}
```

2. **Library Integration**:
   - Primary: `@peculiar/webcrypto` with PQC extensions
   - Alternative: `liboqs-node` (Open Quantum Safe bindings)
   - Fallback: Custom implementation of CRYSTALS-Kyber/Dilithium

#### Technical Requirements:
```typescript
// REPLACE simulated quantum keys with:
import { Kyber, Dilithium } from '@peculiar/webcrypto-pqc';

class ProductionQuantumCrypto {
  async generateKyberKeyPair(): Promise<QuantumKeyPair> {
    // Real Kyber-768 key generation
    const keyPair = await Kyber.generateKey({ name: "Kyber", namedCurve: "Kyber-768" });
    return {
      publicKey: await crypto.subtle.exportKey("raw", keyPair.publicKey),
      privateKey: await crypto.subtle.exportKey("pkcs8", keyPair.privateKey)
    };
  }
  
  async signWithDilithium(data: ArrayBuffer, privateKey: CryptoKey): Promise<ArrayBuffer> {
    // Real Dilithium digital signatures
    return await crypto.subtle.sign("Dilithium", privateKey, data);
  }
}
```

#### Algorithm Requirements:
- **Key Exchange**: CRYSTALS-Kyber (NIST standard)
- **Digital Signatures**: CRYSTALS-Dilithium (NIST standard)

#### Mathematical Requirements:
```typescript
// Implement formal 2-of-3 verification
class TrinityMathematicalCore {
  verifyConsensus(ethereumProof: Proof, solanaProof: Proof, tonProof: Proof): boolean {
    // Mathematical verification that at least 2 of 3 chains agree
    const validProofs = [ethereumProof, solanaProof, tonProof]
      .filter(proof => this.verifyChainProof(proof));
    
    return validProofs.length >= 2;
  }
  
  verifyChainProof(proof: Proof): boolean {
    // Cryptographic verification of individual chain proof
    return this.verifyMerkleInclusion(proof.merkleProof) &&
           this.verifyDigitalSignature(proof.validatorSignature) &&
           this.verifyBlockFinality(proof.blockHash);
  }
}
```
