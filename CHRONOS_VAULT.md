## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, utilizing TailwindCSS with shadcn/ui for a modern and responsive user interface. Wouter handles client-side routing, and React Query manages server state. The platform includes a multi-chain wallet authentication system and WebSocket integration for real-time updates. The UI consolidates numerous pages into core hubs for improved user experience and navigation, such as the Operations & Monitoring Hub, Cross-Chain Bridge Hub, and Security Control Center.

**Security Pages Organization (October 2025):**
- Security Control Center - Main dashboard for all security features
- Trinity Protocol™ - Full multi-chain wallet integration (MetaMask, Phantom, TON Keeper) with FIXED 2-of-3 chain consensus: Ethereum Layer 2 (Arbitrum) = Primary, Solana = Monitor, TON = Backup
- TON Emergency Recovery - Comprehensive emergency vault recovery system with real-time 3-chain verification status (requires ALL 3 chains for maximum security)
- Behavioral Authentication - AI-powered user behavior analysis
- Quantum-Resistant Security - Progressive quantum shield implementation
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs - ZK verification service and proof aggregation

**Payment System:**
- **100% CRYPTO-ONLY** - NO STRIPE, NO FIAT CURRENCY
- Payments via wallet connections: MetaMask (Ethereum), Phantom (Solana), TON Keeper (TON)
- Users pay directly with their connected blockchain wallets
- Blockchain-native platform - all transactions on-chain

### Technical Implementations
The backend uses Express.js with TypeScript, providing a RESTful API and WebSocket implementation for real-time communication. Security features include JWT-based authentication with multi-signature support, advanced encryption, rate limiting, and audit trails. Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, managed with Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations and Drizzle Kit for schema migrations.

### Feature Specifications
- **Multi-Chain Integration**: Primary operations on Ethereum Layer 2 (Arbitrum) with 95% lower fees, high-frequency monitoring on Solana, and quantum-resistant security with TON. REAL cross-chain bridge with deployed smart contracts facilitates trustless asset transfers.
- **Vault System**: Offers 22 specialized vault types (e.g., Time Lock, Multi-Signature, Quantum-Resistant, Geo-Location) with configurable security levels (Standard, Enhanced, Maximum) and support for various cryptocurrencies and NFTs.
- **Security Framework**: Implements the Trinity Protocol for triple-chain security, zero-knowledge proofs for privacy, AI-powered threat monitoring, and quantum-resistant encryption.
- **Authentication System**: Supports popular wallets (MetaMask, Phantom, TON Keeper), multi-signature requirements, secure session management, and various account recovery options. **REAL wallet connections** with TonConnectUI modal for TON Keeper (not mock) and proper base64 signature encoding for Phantom verification.
- **Real Bridge with Trinity Protocol**: Layer 2 deployment ready - backend supports both Ethereum Sepolia (legacy) and Arbitrum Sepolia via ETHEREUM_NETWORK env var. Implements TRUSTLESS 2-of-3 consensus verification. Supports HTLC atomic swaps with hash time-locked contracts for mathematical security guarantees.

### System Design Choices
The system employs a Trinity Protocol for 2-of-3 consensus verification across Ethereum, Solana, and TON, ensuring funds remain safe even if one chain is compromised. Mathematical Merkle Proofs are used for cross-chain verification, enabling secure and unbypassable unlock conditions. The architecture prioritizes enterprise-grade security and scalability.

**TRINITY PROTOCOL IMPLEMENTATION** (October 2025):
- FULLY OPERATIONAL 3-chain verification system with DEPLOYED PROGRAMS
- **FIXED BLOCKCHAIN ROLES** (Layer 2 Optimized):
  - Ethereum Layer 2 (Arbitrum) = PRIMARY SECURITY (95% lower fees than L1)
  - Solana = RAPID VALIDATION (high-frequency monitoring) ✅ DEPLOYED & INTEGRATED
  - TON = QUANTUM-RESISTANT BACKUP (emergency recovery)
  - 2-of-3 mathematical consensus: Even if Arbitrum has issues, Solana + TON consensus protects assets
  - Layer 2 inherits Ethereum's base layer security through fraud proofs
- Wallet Integration: MetaMask (Ethereum), Phantom (Solana), TON Keeper (TON) all working
- Emergency Recovery: Real-time verification status from all 3 blockchains
- Backend API: `/api/trinity/emergency-recovery` with proper success/failure handling
- Per-chain verification details returned even when consensus fails
- **Solana Integration (October 5, 2025):**
  - Backend: SolanaProgramClient class interfaces with deployed Solana program
  - API Endpoint: `/api/solana/status` exposes program ID, current slot, RPC URL, network, explorer URL
  - Trinity Protocol: Uses SolanaProgramClient for real on-chain verification (not mock)
  - Frontend: SecurityServiceAggregator calls backend API for Solana chain status monitoring
  - Development Mode: Automated Recovery Protocol health checks disabled to prevent false degradation warnings
