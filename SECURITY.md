## üîê Our Security Commitment

Chronos Vault is built on the principle of **"Trust Math, Not Humans"**. Every security claim is mathematically proven through formal verification, not just audited.

### Mathematical Security Guarantees
- **35/35 Theorems Proven** using Lean 4 theorem prover
- **2-of-3 Trinity Protocol** consensus across Arbitrum, Solana, TON
- **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography** (ML-KEM-1024, CRYSTALS-Dilithium-5)
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** for privacy-preserving verification
- **P(attack) < 10^-18** - Mathematically negligible compromise probability

## üõ°Ô∏è Reporting a Security Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure:

### 1. **DO NOT** Create Public Issues
- Never disclose vulnerabilities in public GitHub issues
- Never discuss exploits in public forums or social media
- Keep findings confidential until we've released a fix

### 2. **Report Securely**

**Email**: chronosvaulty@chronosvault.org

**Include**:
1. **Description**: Clear explanation of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential damage or exploit scenario
3. **Proof of Concept**: Steps to reproduce (if safe)
4. **Affected Components**: Contracts, services, or systems impacted
5. **Suggested Fix**: If you have recommendations
6. **Your Contact**: For follow-up and bounty payment

**Example Report**:
```
Subject: [CRITICAL] Time-lock bypass vulnerability in ChronosVault

Description: Found a way to bypass VDF time-locks using...
Impact: Allows early withdrawal of locked funds
Theorem Affected: Theorem 3 (Time-lock Enforcement)
Steps to Reproduce: ...
```

### 3. **Response Timeline**

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **24 hours** | Initial acknowledgment of receipt |
| **72 hours** | Severity assessment and triage |
| **7 days** | Detailed response with fix timeline |
| **30 days** | Fix deployed (critical issues) |
| **90 days** | Public disclosure (after fix) |

## üí∞ Bug Bounty Program

See **[BUG_BOUNTY.md](./BUG_BOUNTY.md)** for reward details:

| Severity | Reward | Examples |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Critical** | $25,000 - $50,000 | Unauthorized fund withdrawal, time-lock bypass |
| **High** | $10,000 - $25,000 | DoS of Trinity Protocol, bridge exploit |
| **Medium** | $2,500 - $10,000 | Front-running attacks, privacy leaks |
| **Low** | $500 - $2,500 | UI bugs, non-critical issues |

## üî¨ Formal Verification

### Mathematical Proof vs Traditional Audits

| Traditional Audit | Chronos Vault (Formal Verification) |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| "We didn't find bugs" | "Bugs are mathematically impossible" |
| Human review | Computer-verified logic |
| ~70-90% coverage | 100% coverage |
| Trust auditor | Verify yourself (5 min) |

### Verify Security Claims Yourself

```bash
# Install Lean 4
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh

# Clone and verify
git clone https://github.com/Chronos-Vault/chronos-vault-security.git
cd chronos-vault-security/formal-proofs
lake build

# Result: ‚úÖ All 35/35 theorems verified
```

See **[formal-proofs/VERIFY_YOURSELF.md](./formal-proofs/VERIFY_YOURSELF.md)** for detailed guide.

## üö® Incident Response

If a security incident is detected:

1. **Immediate**: Circuit breakers activated automatically
2. **Within 1 hour**: Emergency multi-sig convened
3. **Within 6 hours**: User notification via all channels
4. **Within 24 hours**: Post-mortem and fix deployed

See **[INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md](./INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md)** for full protocol.
