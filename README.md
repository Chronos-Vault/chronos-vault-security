## üîê Security Architecture

Chronos Vault implements **Trinity Protocol** - a revolutionary 2-of-3 consensus system across three independent blockchains:

### Multi-Chain Security Model

| Blockchain | Role | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| **Ethereum Layer 2 (Arbitrum)** | Primary Security | Main security layer with 95% lower fees than L1 |
| **Solana** | Rapid Validation | High-frequency monitoring and validation |
| **TON** | Quantum-Resistant Backup | Emergency recovery and future-proof encryption |

### Mathematical Security Guarantees

- **2-of-3 Consensus**: Funds remain safe even if one chain is compromised
- **Merkle Proof Verification**: Cryptographic proofs, not trust assumptions
- **HTLC Atomic Swaps**: Hash Time-Locked Contracts for trustless cross-chain transfers
- **No Human Validators**: Pure mathematical consensus

## üÜò Emergency Procedures

### Incident Response

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** disclose publicly
2. Email: security@chronosvault.org
3. Include detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow 48 hours for initial response

### Emergency Recovery

The Trinity Protocol includes emergency recovery mechanisms:

- **TON Emergency Recovery**: Restore vaults using 3-chain verification
- **Multi-Chain Consensus**: Requires ALL 3 chains for maximum security
- **Time-Locked Recovery**: Delayed execution prevents rushed decisions
- **Guardian Override**: Multi-signature emergency intervention

---

## üèÜ Security Best Practices

### For Developers

- Always use environment variables for secrets
- Never commit private keys to repositories
- Implement rate limiting on all APIs
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Enable HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Implement proper session management
- Regular dependency updates

### For Users

- Use hardware wallets for large amounts
- Enable 2FA on all accounts
- Verify contract addresses before interacting
- Start with small amounts on testnet
- Keep private keys offline and backed up
- Use multi-signature vaults for high-value assets
- Monitor your vaults regularly
