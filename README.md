# Chronos Vault Security

> Security protocols, audit reports, and emergency response procedures for the Chronos Vault multi-chain digital vault platform.

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](./LICENSE)

## üõ°Ô∏è About This Repository

This repository contains all security-related documentation, audit reports, incident response procedures, and security best practices for the Chronos Vault ecosystem. Our commitment to transparency and mathematical security drives everything we build.

## üîê Security Architecture

Chronos Vault implements **Trinity Protocol** - a revolutionary 2-of-3 consensus system across three independent blockchains:

### Multi-Chain Security Model

| Blockchain | Role | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| **Ethereum Layer 2 (Arbitrum)** | Primary Security | Main security layer with 95% lower fees than L1 |
| **Solana** | Rapid Validation | High-frequency monitoring and validation |
| **TON** | Quantum-Resistant Backup | Emergency recovery and future-proof encryption |

### Mathematical Security Guarantees

- **2-of-3 Consensus**: Funds remain safe even if one chain is compromised
- **Merkle Proof Verification**: Cryptographic proofs, not trust assumptions
- **HTLC Atomic Swaps**: Hash Time-Locked Contracts for trustless cross-chain transfers
- **No Human Validators**: Pure mathematical consensus
- **Attack Probability**: 10^-18 (one in a quintillion)

---

## üÜï Latest Security Implementations

### MEV Protection System
**File**: `server/security/mev-protection.ts`

Advanced protection against MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks on Arbitrum L2:

- **Commit-Reveal Scheme**: Two-phase transaction submission prevents front-running
- **Flashbots Integration**: Private mempool submission blocks sandwich attacks
- **Persistent Nonce Storage**: Ensures commitment integrity across phases
- **Time-Locked Execution**: Prevents MEV exploitation with configurable delays

**Protection Against**:
- Front-running attacks
- Sandwich attacks
- Transaction reordering exploits
- MEV bot arbitrage

### Trustless Circuit Breakers V3
**Files**: `contracts/ethereum/CrossChainBridgeV3.sol`, `contracts/ethereum/CVTBridgeV3.sol`

Mathematical anomaly detection with automatic pause mechanisms - **NO HUMAN CONTROL**.

**CrossChainBridgeV3 Thresholds**:
- Volume Spike: Auto-pause on 500% increase (5x normal 24h volume)
- Failed Proofs: Auto-pause on 20% failure rate (1-hour window)
- Same-Block Ops: Auto-pause after 10 operations in single block
- Auto-Recovery: 4-hour delay or 2-of-3 Trinity consensus override

**CVTBridgeV3 Thresholds**:
- Volume Spike: Auto-pause on 500% increase (5x normal 24h volume)
- Failed Signatures: Auto-pause on 20% failure rate (1-hour window)
- Same-Block Bridges: Auto-pause after 5 bridges in single block
- Auto-Recovery: 2-hour delay or Trinity consensus override

### Real-Time Anomaly Detection
**File**: `server/security/anomaly-detector.ts`

Continuous monitoring system for cross-chain operations with mathematical triggers:

**Monitored Metrics**:
- Volume Spikes: 24-hour rolling average comparison
- Proof Failures: 1-hour failure rate tracking
- Gas Anomalies: Deviation from average gas prices
- Same-Block Operations: Rapid transaction clustering detection

**Auto-Trigger Actions**:
1. Detect anomaly threshold violation
2. Log security event with full metrics
3. Trigger circuit breaker pause
4. Alert emergency multi-sig team
5. Wait for auto-recovery or manual override

### Emergency Multi-Signature System
**File**: `contracts/ethereum/EmergencyMultiSig.sol`

2-of-3 multi-signature contract for critical security responses:

- **2-of-3 Consensus**: Minimum signatures for emergency actions
- **48-Hour Time-Lock**: Prevents hasty decisions
- **Action Types**: Circuit breaker override, contract pause, emergency withdrawal
- **Transparent Execution**: All actions on-chain and auditable
