> Incident response procedures and emergency protocols for the Chronos Vault platform

## üö® Emergency Response Framework

### Response Team Structure

**Incident Response Team**:

- **Smart Contract Engineer**: Contract analysis and emergency actions
- **Backend Engineer**: System monitoring and mitigation
- **Community Manager**: User communication and updates

**Multi-Sig Emergency Controllers** (2-of-3 required):
- Controller 1: Security Lead
- Controller 2: Smart Contract Engineer  
- Controller 3: Platform Architect

---

## üî¥ Critical Incident Types

### 1. Circuit Breaker Activation

**Auto-Triggered Scenarios**:
- Volume spike exceeds 500% (5x normal 24h average)
- Failed proof rate exceeds 20% (1-hour window)
- Failed signature rate exceeds 20% (1-hour window)
- Same-block operations exceed threshold (10 for bridge, 5 for CVT)

**Immediate Actions**:
```bash
# Check circuit breaker status
curl https://api.chronosvault.com/api/bridge/circuit-breaker/status

# Monitor live contracts
# CrossChainBridgeV3: 0x39601883CD9A115Aba0228fe0620f468Dc710d54
# CVTBridgeV3: 0x00d02550f2a8Fd2CeCa0d6b7882f05Beead1E5d0
```

**Auto-Recovery**:
- **CrossChainBridgeV3**: 4-hour automatic recovery
- **CVTBridgeV3**: 2-hour automatic recovery
- **Manual Override**: 2-of-3 multi-sig via EmergencyMultiSig (0xFafCA23a7c085A842E827f53A853141C8243F924)

### 2. Trinity Protocol Consensus Failure

**Detection Indicators**:
- Cross-chain verification mismatches
- 2-of-3 consensus not reached
- Single blockchain unavailability

**Response Protocol**:
1. **Immediate**: Log all consensus attempts with full state
2. **Analysis**: Identify which chain(s) failing verification
3. **Mitigation**: 
   - If 1 chain fails: Trinity continues with 2-of-3
   - If 2 chains fail: Emergency pause via multi-sig
   - Alert users via all channels

**Recovery Steps**:
```typescript
// Check Trinity Protocol status
GET /api/security/trinity/status

// Verify individual chain health
GET /api/security/trinity/chain-status/:blockchain
```

### 3. MEV Attack Detection

**Attack Patterns**:
- Repeated front-running attempts
- Sandwich attack signatures
- Unusual mempool activity

**Automated Protection**:
- **Commit-Reveal Scheme**: Prevents front-running
- **Flashbots Integration**: Private mempool submission
- **Nonce Persistence**: Ensures transaction integrity

**Manual Intervention**:
```typescript
// Check MEV protection logs
GET /api/security/mev-protection/logs

// Analyze suspicious transactions
GET /api/security/mev-protection/analyze/:txHash
```

### 4. Smart Contract Vulnerability

**Severity Classification**:
- **Critical**: Funds at risk, immediate pause required
- **High**: Functionality compromised, scheduled maintenance
- **Medium**: Feature degradation, monitored deployment
- **Low**: Documentation or minor issues

**Emergency Pause Procedure**:
```solidity
// Emergency MultiSig action
// Requires 2-of-3 signatures + 48h time-lock

1. Propose emergency pause
2. Obtain 2-of-3 multi-sig approval
3. Wait 48-hour time-lock
4. Execute pause transaction
```

**Contract Upgrade Path**:
- Deploy new contract version
- Run comprehensive test suite
- Migrate user funds via cross-chain atomic swaps
- Update frontend to use new contract addresses

## üìã Incident Response Procedures

### Phase 1: Detection & Assessment (0-15 minutes)

**Actions**:
1. ‚úÖ Confirm incident via monitoring systems
2. ‚úÖ Assess severity level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
3. ‚úÖ Alert incident response team
4. ‚úÖ Begin incident logging

**Monitoring Endpoints**:
```bash
# Circuit breaker status
/api/bridge/circuit-breaker/status

# Trinity Protocol health
/api/security/trinity/status

# System metrics
/api/security/metrics
```

### Phase 2: Containment (15-60 minutes)

**Critical Incidents**:
- Trigger emergency circuit breakers if not auto-activated
- Initiate multi-sig emergency pause (48h time-lock)
- Freeze affected vaults or transactions
- Notify users via emergency alert system

**High Priority Incidents**:
- Monitor situation closely
- Prepare contingency actions
- Alert key stakeholders

### Phase 3: Investigation (1-24 hours)

**Analysis Tasks**:
1. Collect all relevant transaction data
2. Analyze blockchain state across all chains
3. Review smart contract interactions
4. Identify root cause
5. Document findings

**Technical Investigation**:
```typescript
// Blockchain state verification
server/security/trinity-protocol.ts - verifyConsensus()

// Transaction analysis
server/security/circuit-breaker-monitor.ts - analyzeTransaction()

// MEV attack analysis  
server/security/mev-protection.ts - detectMEVAttack()
```

### Phase 4: Recovery (24-72 hours)

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Deploy fixes (new contracts or code updates)
2. Test thoroughly on testnet
3. Coordinate multi-sig approval for changes
4. Execute recovery via time-locked actions
5. Resume normal operations
6. Monitor for 72 hours post-recovery

### Phase 5: Post-Incident (72+ hours)

**Documentation**:
- Complete incident report
- Root cause analysis
- Lessons learned
- Prevention measures

**Communication**:
- Detailed public incident report
- User compensation plan (if applicable)
- Updated security documentation
- Medium/Dev.to technical post-mortem

## üîê Emergency Multi-Sig Procedures

### EmergencyMultiSig Contract (0xFafCA23a7c085A842E827f53A853141C8243F924)

**Emergency Actions**:
1. **Pause Contracts**: Stop all operations
2. **Resume Contracts**: Restart after fix
3. **Update Parameters**: Modify circuit breaker thresholds
4. **Emergency Withdrawal**: Move funds to safety

**Execution Flow**:
```solidity
// 1. Propose Action (any controller)
proposeEmergencyAction(actionType, targetContract, params)

// 2. Approve (need 2-of-3)
approveEmergencyAction(actionId)

// 3. Wait Time-Lock (48 hours)
// Automatic wait period for safety

// 4. Execute (after time-lock)
executeEmergencyAction(actionId)
```
