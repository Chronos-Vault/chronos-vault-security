# Chronos Vault - ZK-SNARK Circuits

## Overview

This folder contains zero-knowledge proof circuits for advanced privacy features in Chronos Vault.

## Important Note: Circuit Breaker vs ZK Circuits

**Are you looking for the Circuit Breaker System?**

The **Circuit Breaker System** (automated anomaly detection) is **NOT in this folder**. It's built into the smart contract:

üìç **Location:** `contracts/ethereum/CrossChainBridgeOptimized.sol` (lines 88-118)

**Circuit Breaker Features:**
- ‚úÖ Automated anomaly detection
- ‚úÖ Volume spike detection (>500% threshold)
- ‚úÖ Failed proof rate monitoring (>20% triggers)
- ‚úÖ Same-block operation limits (>10 triggers)
- ‚úÖ Auto-recovery after 4 hours
- ‚úÖ Emergency manual override

## This Folder: ZK-SNARK Circuits

This folder is for **cryptographic circuits** used in zero-knowledge proofs:

### Purpose:
- Privacy-preserving transaction verification
- Zero-knowledge range proofs
- Anonymous vault operations
- Advanced cryptographic features

### Technology Stack:
- **Language:** Circom
- **Proof System:** Groth16
- **Library:** SnarkJS
- **Verification:** On-chain Solidity verifiers

---

## Planned Circuits (Future Development)

### 1. Range Proof Circuit
**File:** `range_proof.circom`  
**Purpose:** Prove amount is within valid range without revealing exact value

### 2. Merkle Tree Inclusion Circuit
**File:** `merkle_inclusion.circom`  
**Purpose:** Prove operation exists in Merkle tree without revealing operation details

### 3. Private Vault Circuit
**File:** `private_vault.circom`  
**Purpose:** Create and manage vaults with zero-knowledge privacy

## Status

**Current Status:** üî® Under Development

ZK-SNARK circuits are an **optional advanced feature** for privacy-focused users. The core Chronos Vault platform works without them.

**What's Live Now:**
- ‚úÖ Circuit Breaker System (in smart contract)
- ‚úÖ Trinity Protocol 2-of-3 consensus
- ‚úÖ Merkle proof validation
- ‚úÖ Formal verification (Lean 4)

**Coming Soon:**
- ‚è≥ ZK-SNARK privacy circuits
- ‚è≥ Anonymous transaction proofs
- ‚è≥ Zero-knowledge vault operations

## Development Timeline

**Phase 1 (Complete):** Core security features ‚úÖ  
**Phase 2 (Current):** Production deployment ‚úÖ  
**Phase 3 (Q1 2026):** ZK-SNARK privacy features ‚è≥

## For Developers

To contribute ZK-SNARK circuits:

1. Install circom compiler
2. Write circuits in `.circom` files
3. Generate proving/verification keys
4. Create Solidity verifier contracts
5. Integrate with CrossChainBridge
