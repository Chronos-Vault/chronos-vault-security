# Security Incident Response Plan

**Chronos Vault Emergency Response Protocol**  
Last Updated: October 13, 2025  
Version: 1.0

---

## 🚨 Overview

This document outlines Chronos Vault's emergency response procedures for security incidents. Our goal is to **protect user funds** while maintaining **transparency** and **mathematical security guarantees**.

### Core Principles
1. **User Safety First**: Protect funds above all else
2. **Mathematical Certainty**: Rely on proven security mechanisms
3. **Transparency**: Communicate openly and honestly
4. **Swift Action**: Automated circuit breakers + human oversight

---

## 🎯 Incident Classification

### **Critical (P0)** - Immediate Response
- **Active exploit** draining funds
- **Time-lock bypass** in production
- **Trinity Protocol consensus** compromised
- **Private key exposure**
- **Bridge security** breach

**Response Time**: < 1 hour  
**Action**: Automatic circuit breakers + emergency multi-sig

---

### **High (P1)** - Urgent Response
- **Potential vulnerability** with clear exploit path
- **Formal verification theorem** violation detected
- **Cross-chain desync** affecting operations
- **DoS attack** on critical services

**Response Time**: < 6 hours  
**Action**: Investigation + manual intervention if needed

---

### **Medium (P2)** - Scheduled Response
- **Privacy leak** (non-fund related)
- **UI/UX security** issue
- **Performance degradation**
- **Minor protocol issues**

**Response Time**: < 24 hours  
**Action**: Standard fix deployment process

---

### **Low (P3)** - Normal Priority
- **Documentation errors**
- **Non-security bugs**
- **Informational findings**

**Response Time**: < 7 days  
**Action**: Regular development cycle

---

## 🛡️ Automated Defense Mechanisms

### 1. **Circuit Breakers** (Automatic)

#### Activation Triggers
```typescript
// Automatic circuit breaker conditions
const CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TRIGGERS = {
  // Financial anomalies
  largeWithdrawal: {
    condition: 'withdrawal > 50% of vault balance',
    action: 'Pause + require multi-sig',
  },
  
  // Rate limiting
  rapidOperations: {
    condition: '> 10 operations in 1 minute',
    action: 'Temporary pause (5 min)',
  },
  
  // Cross-chain issues
  consensusFailure: {
    condition: 'Trinity Protocol < 2/3 agreement',
    action: 'Halt cross-chain operations',
  },
  
  // Cryptographic violations
  vdfBypass: {
    condition: 'Time-lock released early',
    action: 'Emergency freeze all vaults',
  },
};
```

#### Circuit Breaker States
- **NORMAL**: All operations permitted
- **PAUSED**: New operations blocked, existing continue
- **FROZEN**: All operations halted
- **RECOVERY**: Gradual restoration

---

### 2. **Multi-Signature Emergency Controls**

#### Emergency Multi-Sig (3-of-5)
- **Signers**: Core team + trusted security experts
- **Capabilities**:
  - Pause all contracts
  - Halt cross-chain bridges
  - Freeze specific vaults
  - Activate recovery mode

#### Example Emergency Action
```solidity
// Emergency pause (requires 3-of-5 signatures)
function emergencyPause() external {
    require(
        multiSig.isApproved(msg.data, 3),
        "Requires 3 signatures"
    );
    
    // Pause all critical operations
    paused = true;
    emit EmergencyPause(block.timestamp);
}
```

---

### 3. **AI Threat Detection**

#### Real-Time Monitoring
- Anomaly detection (behavioral analysis)
- Pattern recognition (known attack vectors)
- Predictive alerts (pre-exploit warnings)

#### Alert Levels
- **🟢 Normal**: Standard operations
- **🟡 Elevated**: Suspicious activity detected
- **🟠 High**: Potential attack in progress
- **🔴 Critical**: Active exploit confirmed

---

## 📋 Response Procedures

### **Phase 1: Detection (0-15 minutes)**

#### Automated Detection
1. **Circuit Breakers** detect anomaly
2. **Alert sent** to security team
3. **Auto-pause** if P0 incident
4. **Snapshot** current state

#### Manual Detection
1. **Bug bounty** report received
2. **Internal monitoring** flags issue
3. **User report** of strange behavior

**Actions**:
- ✅ Confirm incident validity
- ✅ Classify severity (P0-P3)
- ✅ Activate response team
- ✅ Start incident log

---

### **Phase 2: Containment (15 min - 1 hour)**

#### P0/P1 Incidents
```bash
# Emergency containment sequence
1. Activate circuit breakers (automatic)
2. Convene emergency multi-sig
3. Pause affected contracts
4. Isolate compromised components
5. Capture forensic data
```

#### Actions Checklist
- [ ] Circuit breakers activated
- [ ] Multi-sig convened (3-of-5 present)
- [ ] Affected contracts paused
- [ ] User funds secured
- [ ] Incident command center established

---

### **Phase 3: Investigation (1-6 hours)**

#### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Reproduce** the issue in testnet
2. **Analyze** attack vector
3. **Assess** damage and exposure
4. **Identify** fix requirements

#### Forensic Data Collection
- Transaction logs
- State snapshots
- Network traces
- User reports
- Contract events

#### Security Validation
- Check if formal verification theorem violated
- Verify Trinity Protocol consensus state
- Audit cryptographic components
- Review recent code changes

---

### **Phase 4: Fix Development (6-24 hours)**

#### Fix Priority Order
1. **Stop the bleeding**: Prevent further damage
2. **Secure funds**: Ensure user assets safe
3. **Patch vulnerability**: Deploy fix
4. **Verify integrity**: Test extensively

#### Deployment Process
```bash
# Emergency fix deployment
1. Develop fix (with formal verification update if needed)
2. Test on local environment
3. Deploy to testnet
4. Security team review
5. Emergency multi-sig approval (3-of-5)
6. Deploy to mainnet
7. Verify fix effectiveness
```

---

### **Phase 5: Recovery (24-72 hours)**

#### Gradual Service Restoration
```typescript
// Recovery sequence
const RECOVERY_PHASES = [
  {
    phase: 1,
    duration: '6 hours',
    actions: ['Resume read operations', 'Monitoring only'],
  },
  {
    phase: 2,
    duration: '12 hours',
    actions: ['Allow small withdrawals (<$1000)', 'Rate limited'],
  },
  {
    phase: 3,
    duration: '24 hours',
    actions: ['Normal operations', 'Enhanced monitoring'],
  },
];
```

#### Verification Steps
- [ ] Exploit path eliminated
- [ ] All systems operational
- [ ] Formal verification updated (if needed)
- [ ] No residual vulnerabilities
- [ ] User funds accounted for
