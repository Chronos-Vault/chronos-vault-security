  Theorem 33: AI Decision Validation
  AI proposal executes only after passing all cryptographic checks
-/
theorem ai_decision_validation (decision : AIDecision) (validation : ValidationLayers) :

  Theorem 34: AI Cannot Override Math
  No AI decision can bypass cryptographic validation
-/
theorem ai_cannot_override_math (decision : AIDecision) (validation : ValidationLayers) :
    decision.confidence = 100 →  -- Even with 100% AI confidence

  Theorem 35: Multi-Layer Defense
  Breaking governance requires breaking ALL 5 cryptographic layers
