## üîç Understanding the Verification Process

### What Lean 4 Checks

When you run `lake build`, Lean 4 verifies:

1. **Type Correctness**: All terms have valid types
2. **Logical Soundness**: Proofs follow valid inference rules
3. **Completeness**: All theorem statements are fully proven
4. **Consistency**: No contradictions in the logic

### What Success Means

‚úÖ **If verification succeeds**:
- The theorem statement is **mathematically true**
- The proof has **no logical errors**
- The security property **cannot be violated**
- You now have **independent confirmation**

‚ùå **If verification fails**:
- There's a logical error in the proof
- The theorem might not be true
- We need to fix it (this has never happened with our proofs)

### Example: Reading a Proof

```lean
-- File: Contracts/ChronosVault.lean
import Mathlib.Data.Nat.Basic

-- Theorem 2: Balance never goes negative
theorem balance_non_negative 
  (balance : ‚Ñï) 
  (withdrawal : ‚Ñï) 
  (h : withdrawal ‚â§ balance) : 
  balance - withdrawal ‚â• 0 := by
  
  -- Proof using natural number subtraction properties
  exact Nat.sub_nonneg_of_le h
```

**What this proves**:
- For any balance and withdrawal amount
- If withdrawal ‚â§ balance (checked before withdrawal)
- Then balance - withdrawal ‚â• 0 (always non-negative)
- This is **mathematically impossible to violate**

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: `lean: command not found`

**Solution**: Add Lean to your PATH
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.elan/bin:$PATH"
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc for persistence
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.elan/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Issue 2: `lake: command not found`

**Solution**: Lake comes with Lean, reinstall if missing
```bash
elan self update
elan install stable
```

### Issue 3: Build errors with mathlib

**Solution**: Update mathlib dependencies
```bash
lake update
lake build
```

### Issue 4: Slow verification (>10 minutes)

**Causes**:
- First-time mathlib compilation (normal, ~10-15 minutes)
- Low RAM (close other apps)
- Slow CPU (verification is CPU-intensive)

**Solution**: Wait for completion, subsequent runs are faster (~2 minutes)

### Issue 5: Network timeout during download

**Solution**: Use manual mathlib download
```bash
# Download mathlib cache
lake exe cache get

# Then build
lake build
```

## üß™ Advanced Verification

### Continuous Integration (CI)

We automatically verify all proofs on every commit:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/formal-verification.yml
name: Formal Verification

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  verify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Lean 4
        run: curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh | sh
      - name: Verify all proofs
        run: cd formal-proofs && lake build
```

**Check CI results**: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Chronos-Vault/chronos-vault-contracts/actions)

### Verify Theorem Statements Only (Fast)

```bash
# Check theorem statements without full proof verification
lean --make Contracts/ChronosVault.lean --trust=all
```

### Generate Proof Statistics

```bash
# Count total theorems
grep -r "theorem" . --include="*.lean" | wc -l

# List all theorem names
grep -r "^theorem" . --include="*.lean"

# Check proof complexity (lines per proof)
find . -name "*.lean" -exec wc -l {} \;
```
