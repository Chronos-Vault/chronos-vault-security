- Unauthorized withdrawal from vaults
- CVT token minting/burning exploit
- Cross-chain bridge fund theft
- Time-lock bypass allowing early withdrawal

**Consensus Breaks**:

- Byzantine fault exploitation
- Cross-chain state desynchronization

**Cryptographic Breaks**:
- VDF time-lock computation skip

**Privacy Breaks**:
- Zero-knowledge proof data leakage
- Vault ownership deanonymization
- Cross-chain transaction linking

**Examples**:
- "Can halt cross-chain operations indefinitely"

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Medium ($2,500 - $10,000)**

**Financial Impact**:
- Front-running attacks (MEV)
- Sandwich attacks on cross-chain swaps
- Flash loan exploits
- Price oracle manipulation

**Access Control**:
- Privilege escalation
- Admin function exposure
- Multi-signature bypass

**Data Integrity**:
- State manipulation
- Event log tampering
- Merkle proof forgery

**Examples**:
- "Can front-run cross-chain bridge transactions"
- "Can manipulate vault creation fees"
- "Can execute admin functions without proper signatures"

---

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Low ($500 - $2,500)**

**Minor Issues**:
- UI/UX bugs affecting security
- Information disclosure (non-critical)
- Gas optimization (significant impact)
- Best practice violations

**Examples**:
- "Wallet doesn't properly validate signatures"
- "Exposed internal API endpoints"
- "Gas-inefficient vault operations"
